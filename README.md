# legendary-playmat-plugin
Welcome!. This plugin is a work in progress and will be completed in several steps. Manual creation files for a 24 by 14 playmat are in place now. Next step is to create a plugin to allow creation and placement of layers for any playmat size.

## Picking a starting base
Right now there are two available options: [24 by 14](https://legendary-playmat-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/24_by_14_base_template.xcf) and [28 by 14](https://legendary-playmat-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/28_by_14_base_template.xcf). You can always download another sized template from inked gaming and convert it to an xcf file by importing it into gimp.
